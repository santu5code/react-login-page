I have tried simple react project in which you can register using you email and password. These login credentials are saved into the local storage and are used to login to the welcome page. some example of validation of form are also shown in simple mode.

material ui is used to developed this project and it is made as simple as possible. 

Here are some of the screenshots of the project pages...

This is Register page of react.
